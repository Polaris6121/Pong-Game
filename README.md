# Pong-Game
This the pong game which made through python using turtle method 
Pong is one of the most best arcade games, same as table tennis. 
Each player controls a paddle in the game by dragging it vertically across the screenâ€™s left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball.

Turtle is an inbuilt graphic module in Python. It uses a panel and pen to depict illustrations. 

Below are the steps used:

First,create two paddles A and B on the left and right side of the screen.
Secondly,create a ball.
Thridly,create an event to move the paddle vertically on pressing a certain key.
AND at last create the function to update the score after each player misses a collision.





# Import required library
import turtle

# Create screen
sc = turtle.Screen()
sc.title("Pong game")
sc.bgcolor("white")
sc.setup(width=1000, height=600)


# Left paddle
left_pad = turtle.Turtle()
left_pad.speed(0)
left_pad.shape("square")
left_pad.color("black")
left_pad.shapesize(stretch_wid=6, stretch_len=2)
left_pad.penup()
left_pad.goto(-400, 0)


# Right paddle
right_pad = turtle.Turtle()
right_pad.speed(0)
right_pad.shape("square")
right_pad.color("black")
right_pad.shapesize(stretch_wid=6, stretch_len=2)
right_pad.penup()
right_pad.goto(400, 0)


# Ball of circle shape
hit_ball = turtle.Turtle()
hit_ball.speed(40)
hit_ball.shape("circle")
hit_ball.color("blue")
hit_ball.penup()
hit_ball.goto(0, 0)
hit_ball.dx = 5
hit_ball.dy = -5
